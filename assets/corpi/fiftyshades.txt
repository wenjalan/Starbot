- No. Stop.
- You silly fucking twit.

You are one stupid fucking bitch,
you know that.



Shut the fuck up.
No.

There you are.

No! No.

You little shit.

No!

Anastasia Steele?

Thanks.

Yeah, got it.

- Good morning, Mr Hyde.
- Anna, please, just Jack.

Tea right?
Weak, black.

I'm supposed to get this
for you but Thank you! Jack.

Hi! This is amazing.
It's all coral and turtles and booze and..



You should be here.
Why aren't you here?

And tell that douchebag brother
of mine to take a day off for once.

Alright, Bye Anna.
Bye..!

This for me?
Nah, they can wait.

Okay. Look nice.
Going out tonight?

A friend of mine has a photography
exhibition opening tonight.

So, can I go?
Good.

How did you make out with those
manuscripts? Oh, really great actually.

...This one, um..
Voice Fox.

...I coudn't put it down.

It's so sharp and relevant and
I think it's really got something.

- You think?
- Yeah.

- Alright, I'll check it out.
- Great.

- Have fun tonight Anna...thank You.
- Thanks for today.

- Goodnight Hanna.
- Bye.

Thanks.

Oh my God.

Jesus Christ.

Anna!
You made it.

Jose.
It's like, so much of my face in here.

If I had asked,
You'd been like I'm too shy.

Yeah.
But you...

- Is my best stuff.
- That's... um...

- Do you like them?
- They are super...

Large.

All portraits were sold to one man.

You're kidding.

Well, somebody likes them.

They just bought all six.

- All six?
- Dinner's on me tonight, Okay?

I'll be right back.

Anastasia.

It was you. Wasn't it?
You just went and buy all of this?

I don't like strangers
talking at you.

Why are you here?

For you.

Hey. Can we talk somewhere...
Private?

No.

Okay I'm not very good at this.
I've never had..

Never wanted to try again.

- Christian. I know, it's not a good idea.
- Let's talk.

Okay?
Just talk please.

Have dinner with me.

Okay, fine.
I'll have dinner with you.

Because I'm hungry, but we are
only talking. And that is it.

- Would like some more time?
- Two steaks, medium fries.

Green vegetables.

Actually I'm gonna
have a King more Salad.

Fine..

And two glasses of
Browseable Liquares.

We only sell that by the bottle sir.

- A bottle then.
- Yes Sir.

Thanks.

So...

Let's talk.

I want you back.

I like to re-negotiate terms.

But I don't see how.

Of things you would said
That's the way you are.

But what happened last time.
Is not gonna happen again.

How can you say that?

I know that I asked you to,

...show me how far I can go but..

You aren't getting off on
the pain you inflicted.

That's still in you.

I'm working on it.

Working on what?

I can't do this if
you won't talk to me.

- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

Fine.

Yo, we'll manage.

My birth mother died
when I was four.

She was an addict, crack.

You could fill in the blanks.

- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I did..

But you were asleep at that time.

Okay.
Well, umm..

Generally...

A key part of communication is
that both parties be conscious.

I'm really sorry about your mother.

It's in the past.

Now,
I brought you here to negotiate.

You are open to new terms?

No rules.

No punishments.

No rules. No punishments.
And no more secrets.

I can do that..

You want a...
What do you call it?

A vanilla relationship?

I mean we only do what
you are comfortable with.

But you need all these things.

I need you more.

- Ms Steele.
- Thanks Taylor.

No strings attached.

This is spiky.
I like it.

- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay, good night.

Anna!

I've been hearing a lot of
good things about you. Oh.

Told you Liz..

- This one actually reads.
- Hey Jack.

What's the head of HR doing
lurking around? Are we in trouble?

Not at all,
I'm just here to encourage.

Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lauries would do the trick.

Sorry meetings, otherwise...

- Who's Laurie?
- Oh it's a bar around the corner.

Friday is a bit of a ritual.

You should come.
Absolutely, go network.

No, I would..
I have plans tonight.

So have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.

Hello?
Yeah..

Have fun.

- Anastasia.
- I'm sorry, have we met before?

It's okay.

I am nobody.

Hey, Lauries is this way.
Come on, I'm buying.

- Alright...Here we go.
- Thanks.

Where is everyone?

You know..still early.

Your comments on Voice
Fox were interesting.

I'm not usually into
political thrillers.

Yeah, well, I think they are parallels
with Dante's inferno were amazing but..

Yeah, you convince me.
I'm reading.

Oh. That's great.

Hey.

Hi, Christian this is Jack Hyde.

I am her boyfriend.
I am the boss.

- What will you have, Chris?
- Thanks, Jack.

Another time.

Thanks.

Another time.

I can't believe you just
talked to him like that.

- He wants what is mine.
- What's yours?

It's a little presumptuous.

He is my boss, Christian,
You gotta calm down.

Calm isn't really my forte.

I know something that could help.

You know this is
not what in mind.

When is the last time
you went shopping?

Houston.
A week ago.

- What did you buy?
- An Airline.

Here.

Your new favorite flavor.

Excuse me.

Do you need a hand with that?

I'll manage.

- I know what you're doing.
- What? I'm being a culinary mastermind.

You only have to ask.
I think we should take it slow.

- Okay.
- Ok... Okay.

Tell me about SIP.

- How is it going?
- It's good.

Jack seems genuinely
interested in my opinion.

What's moral like?

Moral?
You mean like we all sitting in a circle

and singing the company
song in the morning.

That's just for well
managed to people happy.

- Oh my God.
- What?

You are buying SIP?

No, you can't do that.
That's my job.

You can't start
interfering in my career.

It's not about that.

I've wanted to move into publishing.
They're the best fit.

But you're gonna be my boss.

Technically,
I'll be your bosses bosses' boss.

And I'm gonna be sleeping
with my bosses bosses' boss.

Alright now, you're arguing with him.

Yeah, because he's being an ass.

An ass.
Really?

Ass.

You know that's off limits.

I'm gonna need a road map.

I thought you wanted to take it slow.

What do you want Anastasia?

Well to communicate
you have to tell me.

I want you.

For sex.

I was reading
Austin and Bronte.

Nobody ever
measure up to that.

I guess I was waiting for
something exceptional.

And then I met you.

Will Miss Austin.

Approve of this?

You look so peaceful
I didn't wanna wake you.

It's not much for breakfast.

Unless you want cold stir-fry.

Here. The check you gave me for
one day You should have it back.

Keep it.

Keep it?
It's 24 thousand dollars.

Anna...

I make that kind of money
every fifteen minutes...

So keep it.

Andrea, good morning.

Could you please transfer $24,000 into
the account of Ms Anastasia Steele?

No. What are
you doing?

That's fine, Thank you.

Why do you have my
bank account details?

What's good for breakfast around here?

Christian, how do you
have my bank information?

Thank you.

Gotta be quicker
than that Grey.

My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.

I've promised I will make an appearance.
Want you to come with me.

I've never been to a ball.
I don't have a dress for that.

Also,
what am I gonna do with my hair?

I know someone.

And you don't need to
worry about the dress.

It's all gonna be taken care of.

What is it?

There was just a girl over there and
she was outside my office yesterday.

And she knew my name...

and she had a bandage on her wrist,
it was really strange.

We should go.

- Hey, how you doing?
- Good okay!

Hey, how you doing?

- Anna!
- Is that Mrs. Robinson?

Her name is Elena Lincoln.

I don't care what her name is Christian.
Why would you take me there?

Why would you take me to meet the
woman who seduced and abused you?

Our relationship ended years ago,
we're just friends.

- And business partners.
- Business partners? Are you kidding me?

Would you take your subs there?

Oh my god, for what?
Her approval? What is this?

No. It's not
like that.

That girl I saw this morning
was one of them, wasn't she?

Let's discuss this back in my place,
I can have someone come by, do your hair.

Christian, I don't care about my hair.
Explain to me, what's going on?

I'll explain when we are there.
Come on.

Ok,
you either walk or I can carry you.

- You wouldn't do that.
- No it's your choice.

Okay, fine fine..
I'll walk.

Her name is Leila Williams.

She's my sub for a
while about 2 years ago.

What happened to her?

She wanted more.
I didn't. So I ended it.

She left, got married,
I thought she moved on.

But then her husband
died in a car crash.

She had a break down.

And what does she want now?

When you and I were
in Georgia together.

She turned up here and
tried to slit her wrist

in front of Mrs Jones,
my housekeeper.

Oh my God...

Cale took her to the hospital,
But the time I got there.

She taken off.

My people have been
trying to find her.

Your people?

Is that who put this together?

Is there one on me?

Let me see it.

Subject works part time at
Clayton Hardware, Richmond Road.

You know, they didn't
time my bathroom breaks.

You should probably
get your money back.

I had them drawn up and
any perspective submissive.

Nice, Jesus.

I had no idea what
this was gonna become.

- I didn't know it would be different.
- Different?

Really?

Is that why you brought
me to Mrs. Robinson?

Where you brought all the other
women because I'm so different?

- That was wrong, I admit.
- It's all wrong, all of this is wrong.

You put money into my account.
That I don't want it.

You bought the company I work for.

This isn't a relationship Christian,
It's ownership.

I'm trying to understand you.

I'm just wanting to
get close to you.

But it's really difficult to do that when
you keep doing bizarre things like this.

And it's really difficult to do that
when you won't let me touch you.

Come to my bedroom.

Sex is not gonna fix this right now.
Are you insane?

Anna.

Please.

You wanted a road map?

Strike here.

Those are my boundaries.

I can live with that.

Then I'm all yours.

Mr Grey,
your appointment has arrived.

Send him into Anna's room.

- He's here.
- Who is here?

Harold, I think yes?

Your neck is beautiful.

Christian?

Ciao, Bella.

You're just gonna
stand there gawking?

Yeah, I think I might.

So I was thinking.

Did I mention that
it was a masked ball?

No.

Your new bodyguards
need to wear these too?

Just being safe.

You won't even
notice they are here.

Come on!

- Everybody is looking at us.
- Not us, you.

Christian,
I'm so glad you made it.

- Mother.
- Mother is so formal honestly.

Hi.
Hey.

This things are beautiful. And they
are mysterious, they are pain in the ass.

- You look spectacular.
- Thank you.

- So do you. This dress is so beautiful.
- Thank you Anna.

I am so glad you are back with Christian.
He was lost without you.

- May I have my date back please?
- By all means.

- Spoil sport.
- This way..

Anna, My God.
your dress, it should be illegal.

Yeah.
Mia.

- Hey, I barely recognized you?
- Yeah, the new me.

- Well, it is very bold.
- How do you stand him?

Do you know that he was an
even bigger pain as a teenager?

He got expelled from
4 different schools.

- For brawling.
- It's enough.

- Yeah, totally out of control.
- Mia..

- Enough.
- I'll be right back.

- Hi, how are you?
- Anna?

You will be sitting here darling,
Right next to Carrick.

Welcome ladies and gentlemen...

To our Annual Ball.
As you know, proceeds from this evening

will go to the charity That Grace
and I founded so many years ago.

Coping together, working to make
life better for the children.

Of parents addicted to drugs.
Everything okay?

And now thankfully I'll be
handing off my speaking duties

to our master of ceremonies
Mr. Newman Paul.

Hungry?

Now you know what those silver balls do.

- 15 thousand dollars.
- 15 thousand dollars..

Going once, going twice...
Sold!

That's a great start, Ladies and Gentlemen.
Now lot number 2, a weeks vacation..

At a luxury Chalet.

in Aspen, Colorado, donated
by Mr. Christian Grey.

Let's start the bid off at
ten thousand dollars.

- Ten thousand.
- Thank you ma'am.

Ten thousand dollars.

I didn't know you
had a place in Aspen.

I have a lot of places.

Seventeen Thousand.

Seventeen thousand
dollars, thank you, sir.

Eighteen?

- Eighteen thousand,
- Eighteen thousand dollars, thank you!

- Do I hear 19?..19?
- 19! 19 Thousand dollars.

Thank you sir.
A week of...

Luxury in America's finest ski resort.

- 24 Thousand dollars.
- New blood, 24 Thousand dollars.

- Do I hear 25 Thousand?
- The money was for you.

And now it will go to
someone who needs it.

I don't know whether to
worship at your feet...

Or spank you.

- Going once.. Going twice.
- I think, um...Take option two.

Sold to the young
lady in silver.

Let's go.

Is this your room?

Once upon a time.

Who is this?

Is that your mother?

You know you can just say
you don't wanna talk about it.

Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it.

Let's go.
They'll be missing us.

Uh, I just need a minute.

- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay.

Don't forget your mask.

- What?
- Nothing.

Christian has a date.

- I'm impressed.
- I'm sorry?

Elena. I wanted
to meet you.

- I can't say the same, excuse me.
- Hey, I'm not the enemy.

I know what you did to Christian.

All I did was to lead him to
the truth of who he really is.

Without me, he'd be in jail.
Or dead.

And he would say the same.

Do you think you're the first
woman he helped to save him?

He needs a submissive in life.

Not just in the bed room.

No, he's changing that.
It's not he wants anymore.

But it's what he needs.
And you don't strike me

as the type of women
who wants to be owned.

If you really wanna make him happy,
If you wanna be happy.

- You let him go.
- There is no way.

That someone like you could
ever understand what we have.

I've been there nothing less.

Nothing.

Whatever happens between
me and Christian,

is none of your
goddamn business.

So you stay the
fuck away from us.

Hey.

- We should think about going. So..
- I wanna go now.

What did Elena say to you?

Nothing I didn't already know.

Will you just take me to my house?

Stay with me tonight.

Hey, wake up.
We're home.

Sir?

Stay here.

What happened?

That's my car.
What happened to my car?

Check the apartment.
Tell me when it's safe.

Yes Sir, right away.

Smith you stick
with Mr Grey

Where are we going?

Christian?

Do you think it was Elena?

You really think she would
do something like that?

I really don't see why we just
can't go back to your apartment.

That place is like a fortress.

There is no way,
she could've gotten in there.

She shouldn't be able to get
into the garage either.

I'm not taking any chances.

- Hey, Mr Grey!
- The Yacht.

That's the crew.
We'll be here to the morning.

If something would've
happened to you because of me.

It won't.

Nothing's gonna happen to me.

Are these burns?
Who did this to you?

Go on. It's over.

I know how difficult
it is for you to,

Open up to me and...

tell me these things.

You gotta mean
the world to me.

It means you love me.

Yes, I do.

So this is where your knot
tying expertise comes from.

Good morning.
You sleep well?

I did.

This boat is really beautiful.

This is from my Yard in Seattle.

- You build it?
- I had some help.

It's called the Grace.

- After your mom?
- You seem surprised!

Why you're always
so cool towards him?

I will ever think of Grace.

She saved my life after
my birth mom died.

Do you remember your birth mom?

I try not to.

What happened to her?

She overdosed,
they found her body three days later.

- Where were you?
- I was with her.

My god!

Took her away...
Took me to hospital.

Grace was there.

Thank you for telling me.

Look at that house.

That's beautiful.

The view is probably amazing.
I wonder who lives there.

It's an old sea widow.
Lost her husband years ago.

She sits at the window every night,
waiting for him to come home.

- Did you just make that up?
- Yeah.

You want to take that home?

- Me?
- Yeah, you! come on.

You can't do that.

Right there.

- Okay?
- Okay.

- Don't let go.
- Ok, I have to. Don't.

Okay?

- You Ready?
- Okay.

I'm steering it, I'm doing it.

I'm the captain.

- Hi.
- Hey Jack.

Personal calls on your own time okay?

Ya?

Did you get my message?

You had a phone call this
morning with Rick Crussi at 9am.

Shit.

I just gonna reschedule
that. I'll ask them.

Did you book our rooms?
For New York Camp?

Sorry?

The New York Book expo, this Friday.
It's in the diary.

Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I booked your room of course.

And you? I was expecting that
my assistant also attends.

I didnt know that.
I'm sorry.

Don't apologize,
just get yourself a room.

Unless you rather stay
back with your boyfriend.

It's not like you need the work.

I'll sort it out.

Hey Rick, it's Jack.
How was your weekend?

No shit?

They're amazing amazing."
But I can't put it down.

Hello?

Christian?

- Oh, Oh my God!
- Excuse me Miss Steele.

- I didn't mean to startle you.
- No, no...

I...
You were very quiet.

I am Mrs. Jones,
Mr. Grace's housekeeper.

May I?

Sure...
Thank you.

I am Anna. But you knew that
already, because you've seen me last week.

Mr Grey is in his study
just finishing up a call.

- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
- I'll be fine.

You see anything you like?

The door was unlocked.

I'll have to talk to Mrs. Jones.

Does she come in here a lot?

Dust in here?

It's even more intense
when you take 'em off.

What's this?

Ok, that's enough show and tell.

What's this?

Let's learn to walk before we run.

I kinda like running.

Last time we did this.
You saw another side of me.

And you left.

Last time was different.

All right! But not here.

Mrs. Jones.

You know at some point we're
gonna need to talk about New York.

We have talked about it.

You, forbidding is
not us talking about it.

If you wanna go to New York,
don't go with Hyde.

let me take you.
I have a place there.

Of course you do.
This isn't some sort of vacation..

It's a work-trip with my boss.
Who I would like to impress.

You know he's had 3 assistants in
the last 18 months. All of them quit.

- Without notice.
- You don't think I can handle him?

That's not it.

That's what it feels like.

Anna, I know full well that
you can handle anything.

And if you really wanna go,
then I can't stop you.

But I would like to
take you there myself.

Okay.

- Okay?
- Yeah.

I mean of course,
I would rather see New York with you.

God, I hate it when we fight.

That wasn't a fight.
That was a conversation.

That was, you know,
when somebody talks,

and the other person listens
and you resolve an issue.

- That's how it works.
- It's crazy. Isn't it?

- Good night Anna.
- Good night Hanna.

You leaving?

I was actually just
about to come talk to you.

About New York.

Is there a problem?

I'm so grateful for the
opportunity Jack but..

with such short notice,
I made plans that I can't change.

But I will have my phone on me all weekend.
So if you need anything, I'm available.

Anna, have a seat.

I'm really, I'm sorry.

I think you have
tremendous potential here.

But I don't wanna waste
my time training someone

who doesn't take this
position seriously.

- I do! This is my dream job.
- Well then, shouldn't..

going to New York in the book expo,
be part of that dream?

...It is it is...

It was just a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.

Because there are plenty
of qualified people.

Who would kill for this job.

Look, I don't wanna brag.
But I'm a..

Pretty great teacher.

I'm sure you are.

I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.

I've read more that you ask me to.

- And I'm on top of.
- I'm talking about.

Going the extra mile...

...Unless you want me too.

Compete with Christian Grey.

For your attention.

I apologize that Christian was
so curt with you the other night.

Is that what this is about?

Your boyfriend has a reputation for being..

a little ruthless.
Is that what you like?

If you have problem with my work,
then you should take it up with HR.

Why are you being so serious?

What do you think I'm gonna do?
Make you fuck me?

Jack.

I just think.

I just think.

If you gonna fuck?
then you should do it

with someone who can at
least make you smarter.

Not just richer.

Right?

- Don't.
- Don't what?

None of these is serious,
Serious question.

Do you wanna be kept?

Or taken seriously?

- I like to leave, please Jack.
- Plus.

I can make you cum.

Like nobody else has.

Not him.

- Not anyone.
- No.

Anna?
Anna, what happened?

Jack. It's Jack.
He's trying to..

To touch me.

- I'll kill him.
- No, no, please don't go.

Don't go.
Don't leave me please.

Go. It's okay.
Hey.

I left everything.
I don't have any of my stuff.

It's fine.
Let's go come on.

And his pass has been canceled.
Good.

No. Thank you Jerry.
Good night.

Well, at least that's dealt with.

Heim's out.
He's been fired.

How?
That's.

You. But I thought your deal
with SAP hasn't been finished yet.

It's not.
But I know the CEO.

I told 'em what happened.

You'll never have
to see him again.

Am I still gonna have a
job now he's not there?

- Well, if you don't, you can...
- Christian.

You know I love working.

You can't keep me locked
up in your penthouse.

What if I give you a key?

I mean..
what if you have a key and..

You kept some of your stuff here.

Keep all of your stuff here.

And you slept, you know?

Not at your place.

Are you asking me to move in with you?

- Are you sure?
- Yes.

I want you here all the time.

As soon as possible.

What'd happen to learning
to walk before we run?

Well, that's just one of the many things
that we can talk about over breakfast.

Can I think about it?

Sure.
Ya.

- Liz, hi.
- Anna.

Don't know if you've heard.
Jack resigned last night.

I'm kind of a hurry. Seth isn't recruiting
right now. So we're screwed.

So you don't need me anymore then?

We're trying to find
you something temporary.

Could you to fill in for Jack
in this morning meeting?

- At the senior editors' meeting?
- Just for today.

You're the only one who
knows Jack entire slate.

Well yeah,

but I.. I.. I..

You're right.
That's too much.

No. I can
do it.

It's fine.
I can do it.

Great.

Call me when you're done.

We need to print fewer titles.
Stick with established authors.

- Focus on our core readership.
- Expand it.

I'm sorry.

So Anna.
What do you think we should be publishing?

Um..
Newer voices.

Along with your established authors.

Voice Fox, for example,
got 80,000 hits last week.

Really?

Online don't automatically
translate to print sales.

Well..
but they could.

His online audience is
the 18 to 24 demographics.

And those are exactly the
readers we should be chasing.

I mean I can show you the stats. I Really,
I think he is worth taking a risk on.

Maybe we should take a look.

Great idea.

Er.. Anna?

Mr Roach.
I'm really sorry if I was out of line.

No. Don't be sorry.
You make lot of sense.

Now. So what are you doing
now that Jack Heim is gone?

Um.. Well, Liz mentioned
something temporary.

I don't know.

Okay. Well, why don't you
fill in for Jack temporarily?

- Good?
- Um..

Great. Okay.
That's settled.

- To SIP's new fiction editor.
- Acting fiction editor.

Christian,
did you have something to do with this?

No. Hey,
it was all you.

- But you don't believe me?
- I don't believe it myself.

- I asked you a question last night.
- About moving in with you?

I just think that I'm probably..

I need to get somethings from my apartment.

That can be arranged.

Good.

Now, maybe we could,
take this celebration home.

The Check please.

And Jenny need someone to
sign off on the new Crushi.

I kept asking Jack to do that.

Yeah well, Jack was kind of lazy.
Didn't you notice?

Yah. I believe he called
it artistic temperament.

Thank you Hanna.

Hey.

It's great that you're doing this.

But it's totally weird.
I know.

- I know.
- Meaning?

Am I expected to call you Miss Steele?

I expect you to call me Anna.

And I don't expect you to fetch me coffee.

Unless you're getting some for yourself.

And..

The rest of it, we'll just
make up as we go. Okay?

Okay.

Miss Steele.

Damn it.

Take it. I'm just gonna grab
some stuff and check them out.

- I should go over help with you.
- No. It's okay. I'd just be 2 seconds.

It's all good.

Hey Ross.

Leila.

Christian is downstairs.
Do you want to see him?

I came to see you.

Okay.

He told me what happened.

I know you're in a lot of pain.

I'm so sorry.

He lets you call him by his name.

He talks about you all the time.
He cares about you.

Don't lie.

Tell me what you have that I don't.

Nothing.

I'm nothing.

He'll get tired of me.

Master sleeps in your bed.

- How do you know that?
- I saw you.

I watched you.
I know you love him.

I do too.

We all do.

- Why don't you put the gun down?
- You don't know him.

What he likes.
You don't give him what he wants.

He's pretending with you.

No. Christian.

Kneel.

Anna.

Go to... wait for me there.

For once, just do as you're told.

Taylor, get her outta here.

Miss Steele.

- Miss Steele? Anna?
- Stop it, Taylor.

I don't care. She's been gone for 3 hours,
she doesn't have her cell.

Or her purse.

Forget it, she's here.

Where the fuck have you been?

I told you to come straight here.

I have had people out combing
the streets looking for you.

I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.

Maybe you just really need
someone who obeys every command.

Don't be ridiculous.

I saw you. Christian.
I saw the way you were with Leila.

She had a gun Anna.
I would do anything to subdue her.

Where is she now?

Is she here?

- Is she here?
- What? No. Of course not.

She's in a psych ward getting
the help that she needs.

Lucky.

- I know she scares you.
- Yeah. She scare me.

But you scare me more.
Seeing you like that with her.

I will never be able to give you that.

Kind of submission and obedience.

Anna.

Don't crowd me.
I need space.

- Now please don't do.
- Christian.

- Don't give up on me.
- I just need to think a little bit.

Don't leave me.

What are you doing?

Get up.

What are you doing?

Look at me.
Look at me.

I'm scared.

I know you say that I'm enough.

But there are certain things
that you're used to getting.

That I will never ever
ever be able to give you.

And it might be fine for right now, but..

What's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?

I won't.

How do you know that?
How can I believe you,

I don't even understand
your need to dominate.

I'm not a dominant.
I'm not.

The right term is a sadist?

I get off in punishing woman.
Woman who look like you.

Like your mother.

Yes.

And I know how fucked up that is.

When you left,

I swore that I would stop if that's
what it took to get you back.

But I'm done with it.

You mean more to me than anything else.

I want to believe you.
I do. But I can't. I..

Anna, give me your hand.

This is me.
All of me.

- Christian.
- I'm all yours.

No.

No.

Hey.. hey.. hey.. hey.. It's okay.
I'm right here.

I'm right here.

Marry me.

- What?
- I want you to marry me.

Christian.
I think you're dreaming.

- Good morning.
- Morning.

- Sleep okay?
- I did.

- You?
- Like a luck.

Out all night.

You didn't..
have any weird dreams or anything or like.

- Wake up at all.
- No.

Nothing I can think of.

I mean there was a little
thing about asking you to

marry me but
aside from that, no.

Don't mess with me like that.

Huh. Who says I
mess with you?

That better?

I meant it.

I want to marry you.

Why?

Because I want to spend every second
of the rest of my life with you.

I don't expect you to say yes right away.

I know I'm complicated.

Just a little bit.

You have an assistant?
I thought you were an assistant.

Ah, it's a long story.
What's going on?

It's a long story.
What's going on?

The boy already has everything
except the sense of humor.

Er.. his. His birthday.
When is his birthday?

Sunday. He didn't tell you? He is so weird.
Mom and Dad is throwing him a party.

- Didn't he just had a party?
- She's yours but he's his.

That was a ball. This is just family,
friends, music, fireworks..

nobody.
Hey, what about a tie?

Christian has a lot of ties.

- Socks, suspenders, throw me a bone here.
- And, oh.. god.

Mia, I gotta go.

Okay, okay.
But Sunday I'll hunt you down myself. Bye

Perfect.

- Do you have a gift-box?
- One second.

Hey.

Ms Steele.
How's your day?

Looking up, Mr Grey.
Where's Taylor?

He went to get my bag.

Your bag?
Where you going?

Ross and I have to go to
Portland for some meetings.

I'll be back tomorrow night.

When are you going to tell
me about your birthday?

Your parents are throwing you a party.
Were we gonna just stay home?

They do this every year.
Well yeah. Birthday.

My arrival in the world isn't
something I feel like celebrating.

I feel like celebrating it.

Can't open it till the day of event.

Then why give it to me now?

Call it delayed gratification.

Christian.
What is that?

Oh my god.
Oh no.

Christian.
What's going on?

- Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
- What's happening?

Stop it.

Hold tight.
Hold tight.

- Hi.
- Oh my god, you're so tanned.

Glowing.

- Want a beer Anna?
- Yes please please.

- Hi Jose.
- Hey.

- How's it going?
- So, congratulations fiction editor.

- Right. She's a big deal now.
- And how's your hottie?

Christian is good.
He asked me to move in with him.

- What?
- Anna is moving in with Christian.

Oh that's great.
You know, We could use some privacy.

You're so subtle.

So you're serious but are you happy?
Cause that's all I care about.

I.. I mean it's complicated
but I have never been happier.

- Hey Mia, whassup?
- Did you hear about Jose's show?

It was incredible. Really he was amazing.
He got rave review.

- I gotta check it out.
- Wait wait Mia, slow down.

Shit. Okay.
Yea, yeah Right away.

We need to have more time.

You will have plenty of time.

We're still glad that you're here with us.
And in Christian's life.

You've made such a
difference to him.

He never let anyone get..

close. Until
you came along.

Grace. He
adores you.

I know. But children grown out
of their parents and thats..

As long as they're happy.

And he.. is happy..

He looks like shit but he is in one piece

Guys, relax. I'm fine. Okay.

And because of that I'm never
taking anything for granted.

Ever again.

Hey, I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?

I'm fine, Elena, thank you.

Anna, let me introduce to you
my good friend Elena Lincoln.

We met at the masquerade.
Yes..

Nice to see you again.

Excuse us.
Surely.

She's fantastic.

Ladies and gentlemen, Mia..

I wanna thank you all for
coming here this evening.

I was expecting small family gathering,
Thanks Mia..

But I'm happy that you're all here.
Because I have an announcement to make.

As most of you know.
Yesterday Ros and I had a narrow escape.

And something like that,
Reminds us of what really matters.

And how important it is to seize the day.

Anna, come up here a second,
please.

So a while ago I was looking up
to meet this amazing young woman..

Anastasia Steele.

Very quickly I realized
that she was the one,

I wanted to share my life with.

So I asked her to marry me.

And she said yes.

So good.

Welcome to the family.
Thank you.

I wouldn't meet my client anymore.
I would just rehydrate.

Oh My God, don't do that.
Congratulations.

Hi, mom.
I love you.

Well done, big brother.

Ring! Show me the ring.

We're gonna choose it together.

No rock?

...Christian Grey.
Oh my god! I have a sister.

Leave you alone for a couple of
weeks and this is what happens?

I know, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

Oh please.
Come here.

So how does it feel to
Seattle most eligible bachelor?

It's a little scary but...
If anyone can make it work, it's you.

Hey, sis-in-law.

Congratulations.
Christian's a very lucky guy.

...You however are certified

Sorry to interrupt, Mia wants to
taste one of your killer cocktails.

Oh, coming right up.

Nice to see you heat it on our little talk.

What makes you think that I
would ever listen to you?

You don't care about Christian.

he will see to that.
I'll make sure of it.

He'll see right through you.
It's over for you... Elena.

You're just a mousy little
thing after his money.

He's not capable of marriage.

Thank you, Christian.

Why're you even here Elena?

She's not right for you.
You don't know what's right for me.

You tell me how to fuck Elena.

Anna tell me how to love.

She's just the next one in line.

Get out of my house.

Leave my children alone and
get the hell out of my house.

...Anna, darling.

Would you give us a moment alone please?

I'm sorry about that.

Is your Mom okay?

Sure is..

Elena's gone.
Like gone gone?

I'm done.
The business, everything..

I'll have my people sort
out the details tomorrow.

I know she was important to you.
I'm sorry.

Are you?
No... No.

What's that you got there?

Come with me.
There is something I need to show you.

Last time we came down here.
I was over your shoulder.

Oh yeah.

After you.

Oh my God!

- You want a bunch of flowers?
- Oh my God!

It's ok.
